# App Evaluation

## **Movie App**
### Mobile: 
It can give release dates (can add it to a calender)
It's more accesible as an app
Notifications for when tickets open up

### Story:
With a surge of Netflix and on-demand apps, not many people go to the theatre, so maybe tickets wouldn't be as useful, because there are other ways to watch movies. 
friends : While lots of people mostly use streaming apps, some are still interested in going to movies as a way to hang out with others.

### Market:
Target audience would be movie enthusiasts and movie theatre enjoyers in general, but that would also mean it's probably a small group of people because going to the movies is less popular now.

### Habit:
It's not used to create anything,it instead would be habit forming for people who go often, also with the notifications, it would lead to people opening the app more often.
The average user would probably use it every couple of months.

### Scope:
If we add dates to calender and notifications it would take much longer to do maybe 2 months, 
the stripped down version would still show movies, movie theatres associated with them and possibly the tickets to those movies and it would still be useful.

## **Food App** 
Essentially ask the user for 3 ingredients, calorie restrictions and maybe food restrictions if you're vegetarian, can't have gluten, etc. and then provide recipes from that information (library keywords but using ingredients)

Mobile: If you're in the kitchen, you don't really want to have your laptop there, so we can display the recipe on the app and make it more accesible such as adding a weekly reminder notification to make a meal plan for the week.

Story: 
It's nice to be able to access exactly what you're looking for, especially because there are so many different websites so it's good to have one place to find info, so i think my friends and even I would use it, because you only have so many things in your kitchen.

Market:
A large group of people would likely use this app because many people enjoy cooking or baking and are usually looking for recipes online so this would be a marketable idea.
Cooks, stay-at-home parents, bakers, people who enjoy cooking

Habit:
People would probably use this every week or every other day, people cook everyday so it would be used pretty often
it is used to create something.

Scope:
We think it wouldn't be too difficult to work on by the deadline, we should be able to finish. The biggest issue would be making the search function work based on keywords and getting the information from the ingredients.

we think it would be fun

## **Job App** 
job browsing, showing job information but maybe also with information about that particular job
### Mobile: 
It'll be easier to look through the app, so you can have job notifications based on the types of job that you're interested in which you can't do well on a website

### Story:
It has value because everybody is looking for a job and it would make it easier for people looking to find information about their jobs. 
friends: they would probably find it useful cause as college students we're on the lookout for job opportunities.

### Market:
A pretty huge market because this is something most people need.

### Habit:
People in the demographic would likely be using it daily if they're on a constant lookout, 
if they find a job they may not use it as much but even then they can use it later if looking to switch jobs.
Users will always come and go.

### Scope:
The most challenging parts would be figuring out the search feature but also the main problem would be being able to categorize each job since there are so many different ones to look through.
